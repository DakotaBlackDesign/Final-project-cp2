# Aphos

A mobile Theraputic interdface that generates sound in responce to a users breathing

## Summary

User input will be collected through an accelerometer and a breathe detection belt to trigger a synth over Midi BLE.

## Component Parts

the hardware consists of 2 feather boards, 1 absolute orientation sensor, and 1 knit strech sensor. 

## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: prototype basic functions.
            -recieve Middi ble data
            -digital syth 
            -output sound over bluetooth
- Week 3: prototype user inputs
            -accelerometer
            -touch interactions 
- Week 4: Combine user inputs with synth!
- Week 5: Present!

## Outcomes 

Thesis_.ino is the orientation controller code

Thesis_4.ino is the breathe belt code
